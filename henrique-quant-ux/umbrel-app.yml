  Quant UX is a research, usability and prototyping tool to quickly test your designs and get data driven insights.
  

  Prototypes that feel real.
  All prototypes are fully interactive. Use input widgets, animations and data to make your prototype feel like a real app.
  Visual Designer: Use the powerful canvas to build amazing prototypes. Simply create screens, add interactive components and link the screens.
  Design Tokens: Design tokens make it easy to define common styles that grow with your prototypes.
  Design Systems: Build a scallable design system by using Components, Design Tokens and Master Screens and share them it multiple prototypes.
  Animations: Use the Animation Composer to create stunning animations and make your prototypes feel more realistic.
  Rich Component Palette: The large palette of fully functional components give you a head start! You can start right away to design WireFrame, IOS, Android, OpenUI5 or Lightning prototypes.
  A / B Testing: The A / B test operator allows you to compare different design in one propotype. Choose the better version and create an improved version and benchmark it again.
